## Abstract
_When people talk about place, there are a few key parts of the produced sentences that are particularly useful for GIS tasks,
spatial relations being the primary concern in this paper. Used to describe the position of an object in relation to another,
spatial relations play a crucial role in the proper understanding of spatial communication. In this work, a set of algorithms 
for generating polygons that match spatial relations used in daily communication are proposed. An experiment is then conducted,
not only evaluating the proposed algorithms but also shedding some light on the way people understand spatial relations._
